# Pharmaceutical data analysis of corporate lab research findings utilizing Pandas and Matplotlib in Python

## Project Description:
Through utilizing Pandas and Matplotlib, this project serves to generate all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study, which was an animal study of 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors and received treatment with a range of drug regimens. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens. To generate findings and analysis, I prepared the data, generated summary statistics, created bar charts and pie charts, calculated quartiles, find outliers, created a box plot, line plot and a scatter plot, and calculated correlation and regression.
